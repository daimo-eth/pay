// A Daimo Pay transfer has 4 steps:
// 1. Alice sends (tokenIn, amountIn) to the intent address on chain A. This is
//    a simple erc20 transfer.
// 2. Relayer swaps tokenIn to bridgeTokenIn and initiates the bridge using
//    startIntent. The intent commits to a destination bridgeTokenOut, and the
//    bridger guarantees this amount will show up on chain B (or reverts if the
//    amount of bridgeTokenIn is insufficient).
// 3. Relayer immediately calls fastFinishIntent on chain B, paying Bob.
// 4. Finally, the slow bridge transfer arrives on chain B later, and the
//    relayer can call claimIntent.
// For simplicity, a same-chain Daimo Pay transfer follows the same steps.
// Instead of swap+bridge, startIntent only swaps and verifies correct output.
// FastFinish remains optional but is unnecessary. Claim completes the intent.
