For packages/contract:

- Always run tests with `make test`.
- Read `packages/contract/Makefile` to understand Foundry commands.

For packages/connectkit:

- Use `npm i`, then `npm run lint`.

General:

- Write clean, minimal, neatly decomposed code.
- Order: constants at top, then top-level functions, then helpers.
- Add useful doc comments explaining invariants; one-liners preferred.
- Think hard.
